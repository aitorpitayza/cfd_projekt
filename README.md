Abstract : 

The principal aim of this project is to explore the performance of different numeric methods to solve a problem in a two dimensional domain. In order to undertake such analysis, the domain is discretized into different number of cells and the energy equation is implemented through finite volumes. In addition, different ways to aproximate convective and conductive fluxes are performed. Furthermore, three temporal schemes are studied in order to understand their influence in the solution. The solver obteined is valid for different boundary conditions, temporal steps, Courant numbers, stopping conditions and so on. Eventually, simulation time, convergency, Courant number analysis are undertaken.
